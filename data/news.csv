Masayoshi Son, the chief executive of SoftBank, acknowledged that he made a mistake by betting on WeWork, as his group revealed a $4.6bn write-down of its investment in the office-rental startup. Overall, SoftBank reported a quarterly net loss of ¥700bn ($6.4bn)—“red ink of the deepest red”, said an unusually contrite Mr Son. The Japanese conglomerate had to rescue WeWork after it abandoned an IPO amid questions about its valuation and a shortage of cash. Mr Son is now taking steps to beef up oversight of SoftBank’s many interests, such as demanding at least one seat on the board of any firm it sinks money into. See article.|business
Part of SoftBank’s loss was also connected to its investment in Uber. The ride-hailing company reported another quarterly loss, of $1.2bn, and said it did not expect to turn an annual profit until 2021. Its share price tumbled to another record low, in part because of expectations that Uber’s shares will flood the market now that investors who were locked in to holding them after the company’s IPO in May are free to sell.|business

The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate for the third time this year, shaving off another quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.5% and 1.75%. Arguments have raged at the central bank about the need for further easing in America’s still robust economy. Many have read the runes of the carefully worded statement by Jerome Powell, the Fed’s chairman, that “policy is likely to remain appropriate”, to suggest that future reductions are on hold.

SoftBank proposed a rescue deal for WeWork, an office-rental startup that delayed its IPO amid investor concerns about its true worth. The offer from the Japanese tech conglomerate increases its stake and values WeWork at around $8bn, a long way from an estimate of $47bn earlier this year. Adam Neumann, WeWork’s boss, who has been blamed for the firm’s spectacular reversal of fortunes, could gain up to $1.7bn from the deal, including a $185m “consulting fee”. That will rankle staff who are left holding cut-rate share options.|business

Boeing also appointed a new head of its commercial aviation business.|business
Climate-change activists want people to fly less, but the New York-to-Sydney route that had its maiden voyage this week would keep travellers in the skies for longer. The Qantas direct flight, the world’s longest at 16,200km (10,100 miles), took 20 hours and carried volunteers who were tested for endurance. The key, apparently, was to limit alcohol intake and eat the breakfast of avocado purée, halloumi cheese and herb salad. If enough passengers can stomach that, Qantas hopes to start flying the route commercially in 2022.|business

Steven Mnuchin, America’s treasury secretary, warned China that a new round of tariffs would be imposed on Chinese goods in December if it did not adhere to the accord struck between the two countries on October 11th. Under the deal China will buy more American agricultural produce, toughen protections for intellectual property and provide more access to its financial-services market, enough concessions to stop America raising tariffs on $250bn-worth of exports. China was cautious about the prospect for a breakthrough that will end the trade war. Donald Trump was more ebullient, declaring that the deal amounted to a “love fest”.|business

An international panel of experts reviewing the certification process of Boeing’s 737 MAX jetliner, which has been grounded following two crashes, published a report that was highly critical of the aerospace company and the Federal Aviation Administration.

The IMF again downgraded its growth forecasts amid “uncertainty about the future of the global trading system and international co-operation”. The world economy is projected to grow by just 3% this year, the slowest pace in a decade. The “systemic economies” of America, China, the euro zone and Japan can expect only a moderate expansion over the next few years. The IMF pointed out that subdued growth has coincided with easy monetary policy, but warned that central banks have little ammunition left when economies are in a “tougher spot”.|business
The Federal Reserve began buying short-term government bonds at a monthly rate of $60bn in order to refill its portfolio until at least the second quarter of next year.

The central bank described it as a technical move, not a return to quantitative easing, which involved buying longer-dated treasuries.|business

The OECD advanced proposals to ditch the current rules covering international corporate tax, “which date back to the 1920s and are no longer sufficient” in a globalised world, and create a system that acknowledges the “digitalisation” of the world economy. The plan would end decades of practice by allowing a country to tax a company that does “significant business” within its borders, even if it has no base there. The OECD wants to create a multilateral framework to override the patchwork of unilateral laws. The new system would apply not only to tech companies such as Apple and Facebook, which have been criticised for avoiding tax in countries like Britain and France, but also luxury-goods firms, carmakers and other highly globalised industries.|business

At a signing ceremony at the White House, America and Japan sealed their new trade deal. The Trump administration sought the accord after pulling out of a transpacific agreement, which covers 11 countries. This bilateral pact is more limited in scope, mostly covering agricultural goods and avoiding thorny issues, such as car exports.

Ahead of another increase in tariffs on $250bn-worth of Chinese goods, Chinese officials travelled to Washington for a further round of trade talks.|business

A 15-year dispute over subsidies in the aerospace industry came to a partial climax when the World Trade Organisation ruled that America could levy $7.5bn-worth of tariffs on exports from the European Union because of the illegal aid given to Airbus.

Royal Bank of Scotland appointed Alison Rose as chief executive, succeeding Ross McEwan, who has held the job for six years. Ms Rose takes over at a challenging time for RBS.

The collapse of Thomas Cook led to the largest ever peacetime repatriation in Britain, as the government chartered planes to return 150,000 stranded tourists. The holiday firm requested a state bail-out, which was rejected amid reports that executives were still rewarding themselves hefty pay packages. Condor, a German airline and subsidiary of Thomas Cook, had better luck, securing a bridging loan backed by the German government to keep it flying. See article.|business
Facebook acquired CTRL-Labs, a startup that is developing a technology to enable people to manage computers with their brains.

Peloton launched its IPO on the NASDAQ stockmarket, pricing its shares at the higher end of expectations. It describes itself as “an innovation company transforming the lives of people around the world through our ever-evolving fitness platform”. Translated, that means selling internet-connected bikes for $2,245 and subscriptions to workout plans. A sensation with svelte hipster-types, its finances are a bit flabby; it lost $196m in its latest financial year. Peloton will have to up the pace as it becomes a public company.|business
Saudi Arabia sought to assure markets that oil production levels would return to normal within weeks following the attack on two oil facilities, which cut around 5.7m barrels of oil a day from output.

The Federal Reserve sliced its benchmark interest rate for the second time within two months, by another quarter of a percentage point to a range of between 1.75% and 2%. There has been mounting evidence that uncertainty over trade is starting to drag on the economy, especially manufacturing. But with services flourishing and consumer spending buoyant, two of the Fed’s rate-setters voted against a cut. See article.|business

The chief economist of the European Central Bank defended its decision to cut interest rates and restart its quantitative-easing scheme amid fierce criticism from Germany and the Netherlands. The ECB reduced its main rate to -0.5%, taking it further into negative territory. Jens Weidmann, the head of Germany’s Bundesbank, said the ECB had overreacted to the euro zone’s slowdown. Bild, a German newspaper, lampooned Mario Draghi, the ECB’s soon-to-retire president, as Count Draghila, lamenting the “horror” for prudent savers who are being sucked dry. Mr Draghi steps down on Halloween. See article.|business
Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy protection, part of a tentative settlement it has reached with 24 states and thousands of local governments to resolve claims that the aggressive marketing of its OxyContin painkiller contributed to America’s opioid crisis. Under its bankruptcy plan the drugmaker will become a public trust and the Sackler family will relinquish ownership. Purdue says the settlement is worth $10bn, but that is not enough for the two dozen states, including California and New York, that are contesting the agreement. See article.|business
WeWork postponed its IPO amid tepid interest from investors and a drop in its expected stockmarket value.

The United Automobile Workers union held its first strike at General Motors since 2007. Around 48,000 employees downed tools, disrupting more than 50 factories and car-parts warehouses. A collective-bargaining deal agreed to in 2015 has expired, but the company says the pay rises and other terms in a new contract are generous. The union argues that it made sacrifices when GM faced bankruptcy in 2009, and that its workers should be rewarded for creating “a healthy, profitable industry”.|business

Ren Zhengfei, the founder and boss of Huawei, said he was considering selling his company’s 5G technology, which has become a source of tension between America and China. The Chinese maker of telecoms equipment has in effect been locked out of the American roll-out of 5G because of national-security concerns. Mr Zhengfei suggested Huawei would share 5G patents with a buyer, along with licences and codes, but it would continue to sell its own 5G equipment. See article.|business

South Korea lodged a complaint at the World Trade Organisation over Japan’s limits on exports of materials crucial to South Korea’s consumer-electronics industry.

Apple’s annual product launch underscored the shift in its strategy towards services, as sales of the iPhone stall. Rather than using the event to jack up prices, Apple is selling the basic version of the iPhone 11 at a comparatively modest $699, which helps it retain customers. It also priced its new TV streaming service at $4.99 a month, undercutting Netflix. The low price may reflect the limited content Apple will screen on the service when it starts in November.

India’s economy grew by 5% in the second quarter compared with the same three months last year, the country’s slowest growth rate in six years and well below market forecasts.

Turkey’s annual inflation rate fell to 15% in August, the lowest it has been for 15 months. Inflation soared to 25% at the end of last year amid a currency crisis.

America and China agreed to resume high-level talks in early October to try to resolve their trade dispute. Negotiators last met in July and there is little hope that a breakthrough will come soon. There was evidence this week that the dispute is having an effect on manufacturing. Factory output in America surprisingly contracted in August for the first time in three years. In Britain manufacturing activity fell to a seven-year low. And in Germany a purchasing-managers’ index suggested that manufacturing had shrunk for an eighth consecutive month. Figures in China showed manufacturing contracting for the fourth month in a row.|business

Google laid out new staff guidelines in an effort to curb the disruptive internal political debates that have come to characterise its workforce. Its employees often take strident positions on social issues and have pressed management to cancel contracts, most notably with the Pentagon for an image-recognition system.

Its latest rules ask staff “to do the work we’ve each been hired to do, not to spend working time on debates about non-work topics”.|business

The European Commission said ending capital controls was an “important milestone” for Greece, which now enjoys historically low borrowing costs in bond markets.|business
Argentina will delay payments on short-term debt held by institutional investors. It will also seek to replace another $50bn of securities with later-dated paper and reschedule $44bn owed to the IMF.

Cathay Pacific’s share price had another turbulent week following the surprise resignation of Rupert Hogg, its British- born chief executive.

Spooked by concerns over trade, geopolitical tensions and the possibility of recession, stockmarkets had their worst day of the year so far. The s&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and NASDAQ indices all fell by 3% in a day. In Europe the DAX was down by 2.2% and the FTSE 100 by 1.4%. Investors were particularly concerned by the yield on long-term American government bonds falling below that on short-term bonds for the first time since 2007.

Britain’s advertising authority banned two TV ads under new rules on gender stereotyping. One ad, for Volkswagen, depicted men being more adventurous than women. The other, for Philadelphia cream cheese, showed two men distracted by lunch neglecting their babies. Mondelez, the maker of Philadelphia, said it chose two dads “to deliberately avoid the typical stereotype” of two mothers. The regulator disagreed, ruling that “the men were portrayed as somewhat hapless” and that the “humour in the ad derived from the use of the gender stereotype”.|business
WeWork’s parent company filed documents for its eagerly awaited IPO, which might happen next month.

Uber’s share price fell by a fifth in the days after it revealed a $5.2bn quarterly loss. Most of that was because of share-based compensation paid to workers after Uber’s IPO, but even on its favoured measure of profitability it made a loss of $656m, more than in the same quarter last year. Dara Khosrowshahi, the chief executive, accepted that investors were frustrated with mounting losses, conceding that “There’s a meme around, which is, can Uber ever be profitable?”.|business
America officially categorised China as a currency manipulator for the first time in 25 years, after the yuan weakened past the psychologically significant mark of seven to the dollar, the lowest point for the Chinese currency since the financial crisis.

The French government, which holds a 15% stake in Renault, has undermined Mr Senard recently, most spectacularly by thwarting the company’s attempt to merge with Fiat Chrysler Automobiles. Mr Senard said he had been “saddened” by the state’s meddling.|business

America continued to fight trade wars on several fronts. President Donald Trump indicated that he would move forward with threats to impose 5% tariffs on imports from Mexico in an attempt to pressure the country to stem the flow of migrants crossing America’s southern border. While there is little support for the president’s proposed tariffs in Congress, even among members of his own party, Mr Trump insisted that attempts to stop him would be “foolish”.

Africa’s most industrialised economy shrunk by an annualised 3.2% in the first quarter, its largest decline in a decade. Almost every sector of the South African economy was hit, according to the country’s statistics office, with manufacturing, mining and agriculture output falling by 8.8%, 10.8% and 13.2% respectively. The contraction can be blamed in part on severe power outages. Eskom, the state-owned utility responsible for supplying nearly all of the country’s power, has struggled to meet demand and is now regarded as a significant risk to South African growth.|business

FCA and Renault hope the merger will save cash to bolster investments in electric vehicles and self-driving cars. But Renault is also in a close partnership with Japan’s Nissan and Mitsubishi. That alliance has been strained since the arrest of Carlos Ghosn, its former boss, on charges of financial misconduct at Nissan (which he denies) and its future is now in question.

Canada and Mexico lifted levies on a range of American goods in response to Mr Trump’s decision to rescind tariffs on steel and aluminium imports from both countries. The tariffs were an obstacle to getting approval in Congress for the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, which will replace NAFTA.

There was some head-scratching this week, as data showed Japan’s economy growing by 2.1% in the first quarter at an annualised rate, defying expectations of a slight contraction. Most of the growth was explained by a huge drop in imports. Because they fell at a faster rate than exports, GDP rose. Like exports, private consumption and business investment also declined, adding to worries about the health of the economy ahead of a planned increase to the consumption tax in October.|business

Urban Outfitters joined the fashion for renting clothes by launching a service for female customers, who will be able to rent up to six items a month. Hiring clothes has been in vogue at the high end of the market for some time, but cheap-end retailers face falling sales and a rise in “wardrobing”—customers returning clothes after wearing them. The online market for renting clothes was worth $1bn in 2017 and is forecast to double by 2023. Urban Outfitters thinks its new service will assist in “a millennial’s quest for constant fashion newness”.|business
China said it would increase tariffs on a range of American goods. This was in retaliation for Donald Trump’s decision to raise duties on $200bn-worth of Chinese exports following the breakdown of talks that had tried to end the two countries’ stand-off over trade. In addition, American officials said they were seeking to extend levies to all remaining Chinese imports to the United States. Both sides are holding off on imposing their punishing tariffs for a few weeks, giving negotiators more time to try to end the impasse. Even if there is a deal, it is unlikely to reduce tensions between the two powers over trade, and other matters. See article.|business

By contrast, growth in new renewable installations was flat for the first time since 2001.|business
The most eagerly awaited stockmarket flotation in years turned out to be a damp squib. Uber priced its IPO at $45 a share, the low end of the offer’s price range, which did little to entice investors. The stock closed 8% down on the first day of trading, valuing the company at $70bn, well below most expectations. Optimists pointed to the experience of Facebook, which, despite a poor IPO and share price that sagged for months, eventually became one of the world’s most valuable companies. Pessimists said Uber’s ride-hailing business will struggle to make sustainable profits.|business

The Paris store is about four times smaller than the vast suburban warehouses that IKEA’s customers are used to; it will also eventually rent furniture to ever more cost- conscious buyers.|business
Lyft released its first quarterly earnings report since floating on the stockmarket. The ride-hailing company reported revenues of $776m for the first three months of the year, up by 95% compared with the same quarter last year.

Worried about the lack of profits, investors sent its share price down by 11% in a day. See article.|business

Apple’s latest quarterly earnings were viewed positively on balance.

But compensating for the bad news the company’s revenues from services—apps, music-streaming and the like—grew by 16%. See article.|business

All this comes as Facebook negotiates with regulators about beefing up its oversight of privacy, which reportedly may mean it appoints a privacy tsar. See article.|business

“Endgame” is a fitting title to an all-dominating film franchise. The 22nd film in Marvel’s Cinematic Universe took a record-breaking $357m in its opening weekend in America.

Investors pored over Uber’s prospectus, which it released ahead of its forthcoming IPO. Overall revenues hit $11.3bn last year, though growth is slowing at Uber’s core ride-hailing service.

Uber is aiming for a $100bn stockmarket valuation, which would make it the biggest flotation in five years.|business
German prosecutors charged Martin Winterkorn with “particularly serious” fraud relating to the emissions-cheating scandal at Volkswagen that happened during his time as chief executive. Mr Winterkorn resigned soon after the scandal broke in 2015. He has been indicted in America on similar charges but is unlikely to face trial there. The German authorities want him to return some of his pay, and he could face up to ten years in prison, making this one of the gravest legal cases brought against a German executive.|business

A strong showing in consumer lending drove Bank of America’s net income of $7.3bn. Citigroup’s $4.7bn profit was boosted by investment banking.

The banks will pay a $1.3bn fine. The German subsidiary also pleaded guilty to steering at least $393m through the American financial system on behalf of sanctioned entities. It is the second big penalty for sanctions-busting recently, following a $1.1bn fine slapped on Standard Chartered.|business

America ratcheted up its trade dispute with the European Union, warning that it was preparing a list of tariffs on $11bn-worth of EU goods in retaliation for subsidies given to Airbus, which the World Trade Organisation has ruled are illegal.

Global recorded-music sales grew by nearly 10% last year, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry. Although revenues from digital downloads have fallen even faster than those from physical forms of music, such as vinyl albums, over the past five years, streamed music has surged.

American boots might be back on the Moon sooner than had been thought. Mike Pence, America’s vice-president, said the administration aimed to put someone on the lunar surface by 2024, four years ahead of NASA’s estimate of 2028 (and before the end of a possible second term for Donald Trump).

Passengers got a taste of that this week, standing in line for up to five hours because of the go-slow.|business
The crash of an Ethiopian Airlines jet, killing all 157 people on board, raised safety questions about Boeing’s 737  MAX 8 aircraft.

Britain’s economy grew by 1.4% last year, the weakest pace in a decade. Brexit was clearly a factor, though other European countries are slowing, too. Britain’s economy outperformed Italy’s and was only slightly worse than Germany’s. The euro area saw growth slow during 2018, and forecasts do not indicate any improvement for this year. Britain’s inflation rate fell to 1.8% last month, mostly because of lower energy prices. Cheaper prices coupled with decent growth in real wages is a welcome relief for workers who have felt a squeeze in living standards. See article.|business

Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, asked the queen to suspend Parliament soon after it returns on September 3rd. The move caught opposition parties, and many of Mr Johnson’s own Conservative MPs, off guard. The timing of the move, though perfectly legal, was designed to squeeze the already-tight timetable for MPs who want to block a no-deal Brexit. Parliament will not reassemble until October 14th, with votes on the Queen’s Speech in the following week. With Britain due to leave the EU on October 31st, Mr Johnson’s claim that any new deal can be passed in the remaining time is unrealistic. See article.|politics
Reaction to the suspension of Parliament was split along Brexit lines. John Bercow, the Speaker of the Commons and a Remainer, called it a “constitutional outrage”. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the Leader of the House and an ardent Leaver, said it was a “completely proper constitutional procedure”. See article.|politics

Iran has since breached caps on uranium enrichment. And tensions with the West rose after Britain seized a tanker carrying Iranian oil. See article.|politics

Sudanese security forces slaughtered pro-democracy protesters in Khartoum—by coincidence, just before the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen massacre in China. At least 100 people were killed; many more were injured.

Other Arab autocracies, such as Saudi Arabia, are giving the junta money and encouragement not to back down. See article.|politics

Venezuela’s dictatorship blocked deliveries of aid, which it sees as a foreign attempt to undermine it.

More Venezuelans took to the streets to demand that Nicolás Maduro, who rigged an election last year, step down in favour of the head of the national assembly, Juan Guaidó, as the constitution prescribes. Mr Guaidó is recognised by most Latin American democracies, as well as the United States and Canada. Several European countries said they would recognise Mr Guaidó unless elections are called soon. Mr Maduro, whose misrule has led to hyperinflation and food shortages, retains the support of Russia, Turkey and, lukewarmly, China. Mr Guaidó said he had held secret talks with the Venezuelan army to persuade it to switch sides. America said that payments for oil imports from Venezuela would be put into accounts that would be available only to a democratic government. See article.|politics
